Etch Mobility is a modern portfolio website, built on the bleeding edge, to help showcase the services offered by ETCH. Etch Mobility comes with **batteries included**, but you are always welcome to supercharge your setup with modifications and custom components. Etch Mobility is:

* Free software.
* Freedom respecting.
* Community-driven.

> Currently, nonfree software is used in parts of the website. The mission of Etch Mobility is to systematically migrate from any nonfree software to free software.

You can view the published website at <https://etchmobility.com>.

## üìñ Installation

Etch Mobility is an open box and transparent. You do not have to guess about the software used in the website or in its construction. Etch Mobility is built and depends on the following software and services.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/psf/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
* [Javascript, HTML, CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/about/)
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/about/)

The guiding philosophy of the project is that open source and [free solutions](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) are the best.

Developing Etch Mobility requires installing the following tools:

* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Firebase Tools](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
* [Google Cloud SDK](https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

See [`docs/installation.md`](docs/installation.md) for complete installation instructions that guide you through:

* Cloning the repository.
* Setting your account credentials.
* Installing Python and Python dependencies.
* Installing development tools.

For a quick start, simply clone the repository:

```shell

git clone https://github.com/keeganskeate/etch.git

```


## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

Etch Mobility is built with [Python] using the [Django] framework. Etch Mobility runs on [Cloud Run] and is hosted with [Firebase Hosting]. Etch Mobility utilizes [Firebase Authentication], an optional SQL database, a [Firestore] NoSQL database for real-time data management, and [Firebase Storage] for file storage. You are free to swap out components for others. Etch Mobility depends on several other Google Cloud services in the following ways:

  * Containerized using [Cloud Build].
  * Uploaded to [Cloud Registry].
  * Runs as a stateless container on [Cloud Run].
  * [Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/) is used for storing configurations and keeping secrets secret.
  * (*Optional*) [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) can be utilized if desired.
  * (*Optional*) [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) buckets can be used for file storage.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for information about the repository's architecture.

## üî® Development

See [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md) for a complete development guide. Development can happen in many avenues. Principally, clone the repository, begin working on an area, referring to documentation as needed, and commit your changes.


## üì° Database

Etch Mobility operates with a NoSQL database, [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), by default, however, can be configured with an SQL database.

If you use an SQL database, then you can build the database models with:

```shell

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

```

Helpful resources:

* [Django Database API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/)


## üìÅ Storage

You can gather all supporting files into the `static` folder with:

```shell

python manage.py collectstatic

```

> Add the `--noinput` tag to suppress the overwrite warning.

You can configure static files to be served from [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) instead of from [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) in `etch_mobility/settings.py`.

* [Serving static files on App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/serving-static-files)


## üêû Bugs

See [`docs/bugs.md`](docs/bugs.md) for a full list of bugs and issues that you may encounter. To report a bug, please email <keeganskeate@gmail.com>.


## ‚öóÔ∏è Testing

Please see [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md) for full documentation on testing the website. Generally, you can run tests with:

```shell

python manage.py test etch_mobility

```

Etch Mobility can be built locally for testing with:

```shell

docker build . --tag gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${APP_ID}
gcloud auth configure-docker
docker push gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${APP_ID}

```


## üìö Publishing

Publishing is done with one command:

```shell

npm run publish

```

You will need to have Firebase's command line tool installed:

```shell

npm install -g firebase-tools

```

Afterwards, you can login to Firebase in the command line with:

```shell

firebase login

```


### Build process

The publishing build process contains three steps:

1. The app is containerized and uploaded to Container Registry.

You can build your container image using Cloud Build by running the following command from the directory containing the Dockerfile:

```shell

gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${APP_ID}

```

2. The container image is deployed to Cloud Run.

```shell

gcloud beta run deploy ${APP_ID} --image gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${APP_ID} --region ${REGION} --allow-unauthenticated --service-account=${GCS_SA}

```

3. Hosting requests are directed to the containerized app.

This step provides access to this containerized app from a [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) URL, so that the app can generate dynamic content for the Firebase-hosted site.

```shell

firebase deploy --only hosting:production

```

See [`docs/publishing.md`](docs/publishing.md) for an in-depth publishing guide.
