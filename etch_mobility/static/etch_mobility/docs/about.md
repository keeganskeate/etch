ETCH believes that everyone benefits when they have the freedom to make the best of themselves. Therefore, ETCH is built with **community-driven development**. Community-driven development is a bottom-up, demand-driven approach to the development process. The 5 key principles of community-driven development are:

1. Community focus.
2. Participatory planning.
3. Community control of resources.
4. Community involvement.
5. Community-based monitoring and evaluation.

The aim of community-driven development is to improve functionality, accountability, sustainability, security, and transparency. Community-driven development also promotes participation, collaboration, equity, inclusiveness, nondiscrimination, efficiency, and benevolence.
